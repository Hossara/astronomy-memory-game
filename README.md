# Out of this World Memory Game
Out of this World Memory Game is an easy to play memory game designed for all ages, and especially for kids ages six to twelve. It teaches basic astronomy terms like planets (and other objects visible to the naked eye) and constellations to encourage STEM learning for fun.

# What You Need to Play
All you need is a computer with a screen or monitor. The game is not yet ready for mobile or tablet, but hope to make it available on all devices in the future so keep your eyes on the sky.
